# mustafe_final_project_ds

Next Word Prediction App built with the SwiftKey dataset for the Coursera Data Science Capstone.  
A Shiny app that takes a phrase as input and predicts the most likely next word using n-grams with Katz backoff.

## About
The model was trained on a sample of the SwiftKey English corpus (blogs, news, Twitter).  
Text was cleaned (lowercased, punctuation/numbers/profanity removed) and tokenized into n-grams (2â€“4).  
Using Katz backoff, the app predicts the next word by first checking 4-grams, then 3-grams, then 2-grams.
